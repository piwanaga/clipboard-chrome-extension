# Clipboard Chrome Extension
Tired of constantly having to click on your LinkedIn profile, Twitter, GitHub or any other social links to paste them into job applications? I was! My goal for this Clipboard Chrome Extension was simple--create a way to store and access commonly used links that I could easily copy from an extension. I wanted to be able to access my links from whatever tab I was currently in, so I could quickly paste them into job applications without first navigating to another page or document.

## What does it do?

* Click the extension icon in the browser to open your list of links
* If you already have links saved, they will be fetched and displayed
* Add a new link with a title using the form at the top
* Click "Copy" to copy your link text to your clipboard
* Click "Delete" to remove the link from your list
